Census Income Prediction (Linear SVM vs Linear Regression)

This project predicts whether an individual earns more than $50K per year using the U.S. Census Adult Income Dataset.
It compares the performance of Linear SVM and Linear Regression on an imbalanced classification problem.

Dataset
Source: U.S. Census Bureau (1994–95)
Target: Income (>50K or ≤50K)

Features: Age, education, occupation, workclass, hours-per-week, marital status, etc.

Methodology:
Data preprocessing and label encoding
Correlation analysis using heatmaps

Models:
Linear Regression
Linear SVM (LinearSVC)
5-Fold Cross-Validation
Balanced Accuracy used for evaluation

Key Results:
Linear SVM outperforms Linear Regression in balanced accuracy
Linear Regression struggles with class imbalance
High overall accuracy is misleading without balanced metrics
Linear SVM provides better generalization and stability

Tools:
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
